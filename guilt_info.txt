Here are some things you can do when you are feeling guilt:

Identify the source of your guilt. Once you know what is causing you to feel guilty, you can start to address it.
Acknowledge your guilt. It is important to acknowledge that you feel guilty. This does not mean that you are a bad person, it simply means that you are capable of feeling empathy and remorse.
Apologize if necessary. If you have done something to hurt someone, it is important to apologize. Apologizing shows that you are truly sorry for your actions and that you are committed to making things right.
Make amends. If possible, try to make amends for your actions. This could involve doing something nice for the person you hurt, or making a donation to a charity in their name.
Forgive yourself. Once you have apologized and made amends, it is important to forgive yourself. Holding on to guilt will only hurt you in the long run.
