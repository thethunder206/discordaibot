Here are some things you can do when you are feeling sad:

Talk to someone you trust. Talking about your feelings can help you to process them and to feel better.
Do something you enjoy. When you are feeling sad, it is important to do things that make you happy. This could involve spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, or engaging in relaxation techniques.
Get regular exercise. Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.
Eat a healthy diet. Eating nutritious foods gives your body the fuel it needs to function properly. Avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of caffeine and alcohol.
Get enough sleep. When you are well-rested, you are better able to cope with stress and difficult emotions. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night.
