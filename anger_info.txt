Identify your triggers. What are the things that typically make you angry? Once you know what your triggers are, you can start to develop strategies for avoiding them or coping with them in a healthy way.
Challenge your angry thoughts. When you are feeling angry, it is important to challenge your negative thoughts. Are these thoughts realistic? Are they helpful? If not, try to replace them with more positive and realistic thoughts.
Learn relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and meditation can help to calm your body and mind when you are feeling angry.
Practice assertive communication. Assertive communication is about expressing your needs and wants in a clear and direct way without being aggressive or passive. This can help you to resolve conflict and avoid anger-provoking situations.
If you are struggling to manage your anger on your own, please don't hesitate to reach out for professional help. A therapist can teach you coping skills and help you to develop a plan for managing your anger in a healthy way.
