Here are some things you can do when you are feeling annoyed:

Take a deep breath. This can help to calm your body and mind.
Identify the source of your annoyance. Once you know what is bothering you, you can start to address it.
Take a break. If you can, step away from the situation for a few minutes. Go for a walk, listen to music, or do something else that you enjoy.
Talk to someone you trust. Talking about your feelings can help you to process them and to feel better.
Do something physical. Exercise is a great way to release stress and improve your mood.
